      "description": "On a planet far, far away, the world’s top scientists are fighting against the clock to develop robots for the next ‘astrocalypse’. The biggest and most important project is constructing The Destroyer, but it’s not quite finished. Instead, this state-of-the-art facility is packed with cute and colourful robots who don’t realise they’ve been cloned, so when they come face to face with themselves they get confused and explode… which creates an energy orb that activates the booster in the cluster bomb! When everything on the reels has been eliminated, it opens up a portal to another dimension where The Destroyer has already been completed. But it needs the energy of 4 power orbs to activate it, sending you into a time loop of fun. Expect volatile warp crystals, an endless supply of neurotic blow-bots, and wild energy Power Glyphs™. You’ll need them all to power up the warp portals that transport you to the elusive Free Spins dimension, the only place to fully power The Destroyer and clear the board with epic wins!",

      "description": "Do you love festivals or think they’re hell on Earth? Well, this festival is hell. Literally. A warm welcome to Scatterbury, where monsters from all over the world meet up for a legendary 5-day festival. Scatto, as it’s commonly known in the Underworld, started as a simple event in 1974 with 1,500 visitors. It’s grown year by year and now attracts more than 200,000 culture-loving monsters each year. Party with zombies, demons, and vampires while you match symbols and fill the Soul Meters with unsuspecting souls. And if you fill the Demon meter you get access to the VIP room in hell, where you can mingle with Satan and other superstars. Maybe you’ll even get his autograph?",
